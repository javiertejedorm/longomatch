// is the simplest one. There is no stream selection, enabling, etc
// just a modification on the functions that manage the player stream
// to also receive a list for multiple streams:
// Functions/Properties added/modified:
// List<IntPtr> WindowHandles { set; }
// bool Open (List<string> mrls);
// bool Open (MediaFileSet mfs);
// bool Open (MediaFile mf);
// Their simple cases are still there, we need to get rid of them later
